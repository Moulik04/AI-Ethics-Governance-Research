# Locating Responsibility in Data Science: Can Ethics Be Outsourced to AI Systems?

### 1. Project Overview
Explored the critical question of whether ethical responsibility in data science can be automated or outsourced to AI, arguing that ethical judgment is an integral, non-transferable human practice.

### 2. Dataset
This project is a theoretical and critical analysis based on foundational texts in data ethics, including Leonelli's "Locating Ethics in Data Science" and Floridi & Taddeo’s "What Is Data Ethics".

### 3. Approach
**Frameworks:** Applied Leonelli’s account of distributed accountability and Floridi’s warnings regarding macro-ethical system problems.
**Techniques:** Critical analysis of AI "hallucinations" and the illusion of control through automation, drawing parallels to class discussions and classic sci-fi tropes like 2001: A Space Odyssey.

### 4. Results
**Insights:** Concluded that outsourcing ethics leads to "ethical erosion" where accountability is diffused and judgment is merely simulated.
**Conclusion:** Proved that while AI can support ethical practice by auditing bias, it cannot replace the human ability to recognize uncertainty and moral limits.

### 5. Key Learning
This project sharpened my ability to think critically about the "black-box" nature of AI. I learned that as a developer, I cannot hide behind an algorithm; ethics must be integrated into every stage of data collection and processing. It taught me to prioritize "reflexive responsibility", the ability to remain ethically present even as systems become more autonomous.
