# Locating Responsibility in Data Science: Can Ethics Be Outsourced?
### 🎓 Academic Research | AI Ethics & Governance (DS 435)

## 📌 Executive Summary
[cite_start]This research critiques the growing tendency to "automate" ethical oversight within AI systems[cite: 8]. [cite_start]Drawing on Leonelli’s framework of distributed accountability, this paper argues that ethical judgment is a human-centered labor that cannot be delegated to machines without the total erosion of human agency[cite: 13, 14, 21].

## 🚀 Key Research Pillars
* [cite_start]**The "Hallucination" of Confidence:** Analyzed how AI systems speak with authority in domains they are not qualified for, such as academic peer review, creating a "collective hallucination" of justified automation[cite: 24, 25, 38].
* [cite_start]**Distributed Accountability:** Explored why accountability in data science is "distributed and fragile," making it easy for corporations to "shirk" ethics through technical compliance[cite: 13, 19, 32].
* [cite_start]**The Gig Economy Case Study:** Investigated how opaque algorithms in the gig economy are used to displace moral responsibility from the employer to the system[cite: 33, 34].

## 💡 Core Insights
> [cite_start]"The result is not ethical neutrality, but ethical erosion: where accountability is diffused, judgment is simulated, and responsibility quietly disappears." [cite: 45]

* [cite_start]**AI will not solve AI problems:** Automation cannot audit its own bias if the bias is embedded in the system's logic[cite: 9].
* [cite_start]**Macro-Ethics over Technical Compliance:** Ethics must remain a human-centered interaction between data, algorithms, and social practices[cite: 30, 31].

## 🛠️ Frameworks Analyzed
* [cite_start]**Sabina Leonelli:** "Locating Ethics in Data Science" [cite: 3, 4]
* [cite_start]**Luciano Floridi:** "Five Risks of Being Unethical" & "What Is Data Ethics" [cite: 7, 16]
* [cite_start]**Martin Heidegger:** Technological mode of thinking (Efficiency vs. Meaning) [cite: 36]
